Automating Rally User story card and Tasks creation. In case if you are doing manually, you can use the [tool](https://rallyautomation.herokuapp.com/) .

Download the template files and dump the Story card name and description and tasks in the form, it does automatically for you.

It is just on the fly, you pass data, tool logic retrieves data and places in Rally automatically, no storage of api keys, usernames etc.,.

So, no need to worry about Security issues as well.

It saves your Hours of Creating Rally content every release with just 2-3 mins time.

Sharing the code, so that you can customize as per your need and add more features if needed and can host on any website as well.

Let me know in case of any [issues/bugs](https://github.com/Manikant92/rally_automation/issues). 

Thank you!
